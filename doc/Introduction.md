With the Search API, you can retrieve a list of documents according to the search parameters you have specified. Clicking on one of the search hits opens the document in the UACP viewer. The Content API however, retrieves the content itself which can then be viewed in a viewer of your choice.![](loiode1762692e0340f097bedc8984d4064a_LowRes.png)

In both cases, you can use the APIs for providing a context-sensitive help in your application, or for offering the information on a Web site.
