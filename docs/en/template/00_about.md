# Instructions for Template Review

## Purpose

The template is designed to cover as many translation style-related topics as possible for all SAP languages and products. It is intended to provide a common framework that helps all language suppliers update and maintain their style guide in a standard and consistent manner.

## Expectations

Here are the five main aspects we want you to focus on during this exercise:

* **Categorization and overall organization of topics:** Topics are categorized and grouped under their respective headings. We want you to take a high-level view of the structure of the template and tell us whether it generally works or not.
* **Topics missing for your language:** It may be a general or language-specific topic. Since the template is for all SAP languages, we want it to be as comprehensive as possible to start with. We have a way of dealing with topics that are only applicable to some languages. No need to worry about relevance to all languages.
* **Topics not applicable to your language:** As we mentioned above, we tried to create a template as comprehensive as possible for all SAP languages. If you find a topic that is not relevant for your language, please let us know in the comments section for that topic.
* **Descriptions wrong or inappropriate for your language:** As a rule, we provided roughly three types of information for each topic. First, a brief description of what each topic is about. Second, depending on the topic, SAP's guidelines for languages to follow for product translation. Third, instructions for editors that explain what we expect them to contribute to the topic for their language. We want you to go through them to see if it is too much or complicated for editors to understand. For easy identification, the first two types of information are written in regular font style while the third in italics.
* **Other areas of improvement:** Any other ideas to help us improve the SAP Product Style Guide are welcome.

## How to Provide Feedback

There are two ways to provide feedback directly on any Help Portal page. One is to use the comment section on the right side of the page. This may be good to use for a general comment about the topic.


The other is to use the inline comment functionality. This may be good to use for a comment on a specific part of the text. Highlight the text you want to comment on and select Add inline comment that pops up.


Feedback on missing topics, the overall structure of the template, or the general impression of the project can be entered at the top page **LINK HERE**

As said, we are grateful for your participation in this exercise. We look forward to hearing your thoughts on the template.

Best regards,
