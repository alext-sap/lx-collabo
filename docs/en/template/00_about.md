# About This Guide

The SAP Translation Style Guide supports the goal of achieving a **consistent style and appearance** throughout all materials translated by SAP.

The SAP Translation Style Guide is the basic reference work for **translators** and provides them with the information they need to create high-quality translations.

## Scope

The SAP Translation Style Guide is valid as of the date of publication. As of this date, the Style Guide applies to new texts. Texts already translated do not need to be adapted to the updated rules unless decided by LX Lab.

The SAP Translation Style Guide applies to:
*	Terms and definitions in the SAP terminology database SAPterm
*	User interface texts and related documentation 
*	Technical documentation (for example, SAP Library, system documentation)
*	Training material
