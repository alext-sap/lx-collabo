# About This Guide

The SAP Translation Style Guide supports the goal of achieving a **consistent style and appearance** throughout all materials translated by SAP.

The SAP Translation Style Guide is the basic reference work for **translators** and provides them with the information they need to create high-quality translations.

## Scope

The SAP Translation Style Guide applies to:
*	Terms and definitions in the SAP terminology database SAPterm
*	User interface texts and related documentation 
*	Technical documentation (for example, SAP Library, system documentation)
*	Training material
