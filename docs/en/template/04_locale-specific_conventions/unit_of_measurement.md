# Unit of Measurement

Do not convert measurements unless requested in the project instructions. In case of doubt, contact LX.

Translate the unit of measurement but do not replace it with a translation of the locale-specific unit of measurement. For example, do not translate "yards" as "meters" even if the latter is a unit of measurement compliant with the target convention.

*Provide language specific guidelines including abbreviations (hr, sec, min, inches, kg, etc.), calendars, use of non-breaking spaces, use of digits vs numbers in writing, etc.*
