# Instructions for Template Review

## Purpose

This template is designed to cover as many translation style-related topics as possible for **all SAP languages** and **products**. We're done with the basic work and are now inviting you to review it from the perspective of your respective languages and fields of expertise.

We are fully aware that this template is far from being complete. We need your expert knowledge and experience to improve it so it will better serve as a common framework that helps all language suppliers update and maintain SAP's translation style guides in a standard and consistent manner.

## Expectations

Here are the five main aspects we want you to focus on during this exercise:

* **Categorization and overall organization of topics:** Topics are categorized and grouped under their respective headings. We want you to take a high-level view of the structure of the template and tell us whether it generally works or not.
* **Topics missing for your language:** It may be a general or language-specific topic. Since the template is for all SAP languages, we want it to be as comprehensive as possible to start with. We have a way of dealing with topics that are only applicable to some languages. No need to worry about relevance to all languages.
* **Topics not applicable to your language:** As we mentioned above, we tried to create a template as comprehensive as possible for all SAP languages. If you find a topic that is not relevant for your language, please let us know in the comments section for that topic.
* **Descriptions wrong or inappropriate for your language:** As a rule, we provided roughly three types of information for each topic. First, a brief description of what each topic is about. Second, depending on the topic, SAP's guidelines for languages to follow for product translation. Third, instructions for editors that explain what we expect them to contribute to the topic for their language. We want you to see if our expectations are clear enough for editors to understand. No need to provide any guidelines for your language during this exercise. You should also inform us of any SAP guidelines that don't fit your language. For easy identification, the first two types of information are written in regular font style while the third in italics.
* **Other areas of improvement:** Any other ideas to help us improve the SAP Product Style Guide are welcome.

## How To Provide Feedback

There are two ways to provide feedback directly on any Help Portal page. One is to use the **Comments** pane on the right side of the page. This may be good to use for a general comment about the topic.
