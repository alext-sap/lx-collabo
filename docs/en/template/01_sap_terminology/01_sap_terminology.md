# SAP Terminology

Terminology is key for user acceptance and customer satisfaction. Defining, using, and promoting consistent terminology helps build the foundation for effective communication.

SAP maintains terminology with SAPterm, a terminology management system, in over 50 languages. It contains terms, definitions, invalid synonyms, invalid spellings, context (a chunk of text that contains the term), and source information.

When translating terms, follow all terminology guidelines and standards on the Support Portal. In particular, make sure you:

* Translate into the language of the target audience. Do not invent your own terms or use jargon, slang, or colloquialisms. Respect and follow the conventions for your language. 
* Follow the guidelines in [Terminology Quality - Target Languages](https://translation.sap.com/terminology.html) to ensure your terms correctly and accurately communicate the meaning of the concept.
* Avoid using the same term to mean different things unless they are already established homonyms in your language.
* Do not use synonyms. That is, do not use different terms to refer to the same thing. See the [standard for synonyms and rejected terms](https://translation.sap.com/terminology.html).
* Submit a query or follow up with LX if there are inconsistent terms in the source text. 

Most concepts are best represented by terms native to their linguistic environment. See [Universal Terms](https://translation.sap.com/terminology.html) for specific guidelines on terms that should not be translated..
