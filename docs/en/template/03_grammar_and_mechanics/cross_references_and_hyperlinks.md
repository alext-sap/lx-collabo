# Cross-References and Hyperlinks

Cross-references and hyperlinks are used to point the end user to additional or related information. They need to be placed in the right position in translation and, typically, there is no other work required. But there are a few things to keep in mind.

* Don't append any explanatory text (such as "English only") in parentheses if the target of a cross-reference or hyperlink is not translated.
* Submit a query if the title of a cross-reference or hyperlink is made available for translation and if its translation status is not clear.

*Provide any other guidelines on how to translate cross-references and hyperlinks.*

*For example:*

* *Should you use quotation marks for a cross-reference or hyperlink?*
* *Should translators use standard formulations? If so, elaborate on those standard formulations. (You can include this information under [Standard Phrases](/docs/template/06_additional_guidance_for_translators/standard_phrases.md).)*
* *Should the title be translated or its translation should be provided in parentheses for the end user's sake in your language if the target is not translated?*
