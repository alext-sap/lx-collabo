# Cross-References and Hyperlinks

Cross-references and hyperlinks are used to point the end user to additional or related information. In manual translation, they are typically added as tags in source texts, so they only need to be placed in the right position in translation; there is no other work required.

There are cases, however, where cross-reference texts or hyperlinks are made available for translation or localization:

* For translatable cross-reference texts, simply copy the translation if their target is translated.
    * See [Standard Phrases](../06_additional_guidance_for_translators/standard_phrases.md) for information on standard translation style for cross-references.
    * See [Cross-References for Untranslated Target](#2) for information on what to do if the translation status of the target is not clear.
* For localizable hyperlinks, pay attention to the author's comment on how to localize it.

* Submit a query if the translation status of a cross-reference is not clear.
* Don't append any explanatory text (such as "English only") in parentheses if the target of a cross-reference is not translated.
* Pay attention to the author's comment for the lozalizability of hyperlinks in manual translation.

*Provide any other guidelines on how to translate cross-references and hyperlinks.*

*For example:*

* *Should you use quotation marks for a cross-reference or hyperlink?*
* *Should translators use standard formulations? If so, elaborate on those standard formulations. (You can include this information under [Standard Phrases](../06_additional_guidance_for_translators/standard_phrases.md).)*
* *Should the title be translated or its translation should be provided in parentheses for the end user's sake in your language if the target is not translated?*
