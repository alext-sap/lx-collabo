# Cross-References and Hyperlinks

Cross-references are used to point the end user to additional or related information. They may or may not have hyperlinks because hyperlinks are not always desirable or technically possible. The following are the general guidelines:

* Submit a query if the translation status of a cross-reference is not clear.
* Don't append any explanatory text (such as "English only") in parentheses if the target of a cross-reference is not translated.
* Pay attention to the author's comment for the lozalizability of hyperlinks in manual translation.

*Provide any other guidelines on how to translate cross-references and hyperlinks.*

*For example:*

* *Should you use quotation marks for a cross-reference or hyperlink?*
* *Should translators use standard formulations? If so, elaborate on those standard formulations. (You can include this information under [Standard Phrases](../06_additional_guidance_for_translators/standard_phrases.md).)*
* *Should the title be translated or its translation should be provided in parentheses for the end user's sake in your language if the target is not translated?*
