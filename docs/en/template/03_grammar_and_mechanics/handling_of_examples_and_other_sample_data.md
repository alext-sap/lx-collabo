# Handling of Examples and Other Sample Data

Source texts may use personal names, companies, address data, or telephone numbers as examples for illustration purposes. Follow the guidelines below on how to handle them in translation.

* Check with your LX contact whether such examples can be translated and adjusted to your locale.
* If they can be adjusted, ensure to also check if the examples are part of a reference that is already translated. If so, use the translations from there.
* If you can translate the examples freely, ensure that you follow the guidelines for bias-free communication and that your translated examples do not correspond to existing people or companies.

*Add any additional language-specific instruction, if necessary. For example:*

* *Should the first names be changed to last names?*

*If there are no additional instructions, remove the text in italics.*
