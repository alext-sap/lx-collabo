# Handling of Examples and Other Sample Data

The source text may illustrate texts using examples such as personal names, companies, address data, or telephone numbers. This topic contains guidelines on how to handle such example data in translated texts.

## General Instructions

1. Check with your LX contact whether such examples can be translated and adjusted to your locale.
1. If they can be adjusted, ensure to also check if the examples are part of a reference that is already translated. If so, use the translations from there.
1. If you can translate the examples freely, ensure that you follow the guidelines for bias-free communication and that your translated examples do not correspond to existing people or companies.

*Add any additional language-specific instruction, if necessary:*

* *some languages may need to provide guidance on whether the first names need to be changed to last names, etc.*

*If there are no additional instructions, remove the text in italics.*
