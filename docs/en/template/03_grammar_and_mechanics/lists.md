# Lists

Lists make information easy to consume. Please follow these guidelines when translating lists:

* Punctuation: Do not add a final punctuation mark that it's not present in the source text. List elements could be reused and reorganized in a way that the previous punctuation is not valid anymore.

*Please provide guidelines on how to translate lists. You may ask translators to follow the relevant rules for your language (specify such rules as a reminder) or instruct them to follow the source style.*

* *Consistency: is it important that the list elements follow a consistent style?*
* *Style: does your language prefer verbal phrases or noun phrases?*
* *If there are no additional instructions, remove the section in italics.*
