# UI Text Types (non-ABAP only)

In non-ABAP products, each user interface text can be classified with a text type in property files. It indicates the user interface element for which the text is used, providing translators with contextual information for what they are translating. Refer to the table below for information on specific text types.

*Provide any other information you want your translators to know for your language.*

> **Note:** It is not mandatory for developers to provide text type information. Consequently, you may see files with no or inappropriate text type information. You are advised to check other contextual information, if available, such as string ID and developer comment.
