# Voice and Tone

SAP's Brand Voice helps make SAP software memorable. It provides principles for the tone of voice and writing style. In short: Be clear, insightful, approachable, and optimistic. These are called the "CIAO" principle comprising of the first letters of the above four adjectives. Based on this principle, the source texts of SAP software are written to communicate with their respective target users in a particular style and tone of voice.

It is important for translators, therefore, to render the source texts in a tone of voice and style that's appropriate for the target user of their respective languages without deviating from the "CIAO" principle as well as without going beyond the confines of what's acceptable for the language. Below are some of the points to consider in finding the right tone and style for the target user (make sure to check with the LX project manager if the target user is not clear):

### General Guidelines

Provide guidelines on the style and tone of voice to be used in communicating with the target user of your language based on the questions below.

* How should the user be addressed?
* Is there any specific way not to address the user?
* What level of formality and tone (formal or casual, impersonal or personal) is desirable?
* Should it vary depending on the user?
* Is there any exception to the guidelines?
* If no guidelines are needed, delete the instruction in italics.
