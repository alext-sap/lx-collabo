# Geographic Names

Geographic names (countries, regions, cities, and so on) are proper names. They sometimes have equivalents (translated forms) in other languages and sometimes not. If you find country, region or city names in the source text, check in references to determine whether it's appropriate to translate them or not.

*If there is a reliable resource to use when handling geographical names, specify here. For example:*

* Spanish: https://www.rae.es/dpd/ayuda/paises-y-capitales-con-sus-gentilicios

*If there are no specific resources to be checked, remove these lines in italics.*
