# Cross-References and Hyperlinks (Filepaths}

Cross-references and hyperlinks are used to refer to additional information in relation to the current topic.

A **cross-reference** is the formulation used in a **source document** to direct the user to related information in a **target document**. It does not technically link texts together.

Example: `For more information, see chapter 3.2.`

A **hyperlink** is the technical means that connects the two documents. It is an optional element in a cross-reference because hyperlinks are not always technically possible or may not always be desirable.

Example: `https://help.sap.com/`

A **file path** specifies a unique location in a file system. In most cases, paths are partially translatable. If in doubt, enter a query.

Example: `C:\Users\ABC\Documents\Downloads`

Use the same hyperlinks and references as in the source text since they convey information in a specific way.

Do not add text in parentheses that is not provided in source (unless requested by LX).

*Provide guidelines on how to translate cross-reference links, hyperlinks, and file paths.*

*For example:*

* *Are they translatable?*
* *Should you use quotation marks for linked text or cross-references?*
* *Should translators use standard formulations? If so, elaborate on those standard formulations.*
* *Should you make adjustments to hyperlinks (for example, if the target content isn't translated in your language, replace hyperlink to point to content in your language)? If so, how?*
