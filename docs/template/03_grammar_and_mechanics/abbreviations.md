# Abbreviations

This section provides guidance on the use of abbreviations in translation.

Abbreviations (including acronyms) negatively affect readability and comprehensibility. They increase the cognitive load because end-users have to remember what they stand for. Therefore, it is recommended to use abbreviations only in exceptional cases and when texts must be shortened due to insufficient space (for example on software screens).

## Instructions for Software Translation 

When you encounter space limitations, check first if this length restriction can be adjusted or removed. This can be done by submitting a query. 

If the length restriction cannot be adjusted, you might consider rephrasing the text or omitting any redundant words. See for instance the bolded words in the example below.

**Example**: It looks like the settlement due items didnâ€™t load **correctly**. Please refresh or try **again** later. 

If the space is limited and no shorter full-text translation is possible, choose an abbreviation that is the easiest for end-users to recognize and understand. To that extent, follow these guidelines:  

* If there is a known abbreviated form or an acronym (especially if it is also contained in a dictionary or even SAPterm) use that. 
* Use one of the following abbreviation methods but make sure that the abbreviations cannot be misunderstood as typos.  
* Once you decided on an abbreviated form, use it consistently. Avoid using the same abbreviation for different words.  

*Delete (or adjust) these guidelines and examples if this doesn't apply in your language because your language doesn't use abbreviations.* 


| Abbreviation method | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Omit vowels	| *add an example in your language or delete row if not applicable.* |
| Join words using camelcasing | *add an example in your language or delete row if not applicable.* |
| Cut the ending of a word (with or without a full stop) | *add an example in your language or delete row if not applicable.* |
| *add more methods or delete row* | *add an example in your language or delete row if not applicable.* |


## Miscellaneous

Even though the usage of & and + are discouraged in English source texts, they may be used on devices where space is an issue. 

*Translate the following examples. Add additional instructions, as necessary.*
