# Abbreviations

This section provides guidance on the use of abbreviations (including acronyms) in translation.

## Abbreviations Used in Source Texts

The following are general guidelines to deal with abbreviations used in source texts:

* Don't adopt the abbreviation blindly in translation. Use the one commonly used in your language.
* Ask if you don't know what the abbreviation in source stands for.

*You may create a list of abbreviations for your language in [Acceptable Abbreviations and Acronyms](/docs/template/06_additional_guidance_for_translators/acceptable_abbreviations_and_acronyms.md)*

## When Abbreviations Are Needed in Translation

isn't bbreviations (including acronyms) negatively affect readability and comprehensibility. They increase the cognitive load because end-users have to remember what they stand for. Therefore, it is recommended to use abbreviations only in exceptional cases where, for example, translated texts exceed the length limitation.

## Instructions for Software Translation 

When you encounter space limitations, check first if this length restriction can be adjusted or removed. This can be done by submitting a query. 

If the length restriction cannot be adjusted, you might consider rephrasing the text or omitting any redundant words. See for instance the bolded words in the example below.

**Example**: It looks like the settlement due items didn’t load **correctly**. Please refresh or try **again** later. 

If the space is limited and no shorter full-text translation is possible, choose an abbreviation that is the easiest for end-users to recognize and understand. To that extent, follow these guidelines:  

* If there is a known abbreviated form or an acronym (especially if it is also contained in a dictionary or even SAPterm) use that. 
* Use one of the following abbreviation methods but make sure that the abbreviations cannot be misunderstood as typos.  
* Once you decided on an abbreviated form, use it consistently. Avoid using the same abbreviation for different words.  

*Delete (or adjust) these guidelines and examples if this doesn't apply in your language because your language doesn't use abbreviations.* 


| Abbreviation method | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Omit vowels	| *add an example in your language or delete row if not applicable.* |
| Join words using camelcasing | *add an example in your language or delete row if not applicable.* |
| Cut the ending of a word (with or without a full stop) | *add an example in your language or delete row if not applicable.* |
| *add more methods or delete row* | *add an example in your language or delete row if not applicable.* |


## Miscellaneous

Even though the usage of & and + are discouraged in English source texts, they may be used on devices where space is an issue. 

*Translate the following examples. Add additional instructions, as necessary.*

| Source | Translation |
| --- | --- |
