# Abbreviations

This section provides guidance on the use of abbreviations (including acronyms) in translation. The following are general guidelines:

* Don't adopt the abbreviation used in source blindly in translation. Use the one commonly used in your language.
* Ask if you don't know what the abbreviation in source stands for.

*If you want to provide a list of abbreviations for your language, you may do so in [Acceptable Abbreviations and Acronyms](/docs/template/06_additional_guidance_for_translators/acceptable_abbreviations_and_acronyms.md) with the statement below. If no need, delete this instruction together with the statement.*

See [Acceptable Abbreviations and Acronyms](/docs/template/06_additional_guidance_for_translators/acceptable_abbreviations_and_acronyms.md).

## When Abbreviations Are Needed in Translation

You may need to shorten the translation when there is not enough sapce for the full text. This can happen with UI texts that have text length restriction set. In such a case, follow the guidelines below:

* Check first if the length restriction can be adjusted or removed. This can be done by submitting a query.
* If it cannot be adjusted or removed, consider rephrasing the translation or omitting words in a way that doesn't alter the meaning of the source text. For instance, you may omit the words in bold in the example below:

    "**It looks like** the settlement due items didnâ€™t load **correctly**. Please refresh or try **again** later."

* If rephrasing or omitting words doesn't help, choose an abbreviation that is the easiest for end users to recognize and understand. The following are general guidelines:  

   * Use a known abbreviated form or acronym such as those in a dictionary or SAPterm.
   * Try any of the following options:<br>
      * Omit vowels
      * Join words using camelcasing
      * Cut the ending of a word (with or without a full stop)
      * *Add other options, if any. If not, remove this line.*
   * Ensure that it is not mistaken for a typo.
   * Use the same abbreviation consistently and not for different words.
