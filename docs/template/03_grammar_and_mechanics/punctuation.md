# Punctuation

This topic contains instructions for handling punctuation in translated texts. 

## Basics 

Follow the standard rules on punctuation as defined in General References.

**Only in SAP GUI**: For message short texts in ABAP systems (transaction in SE91 and SE61), you can stick to the traditional pattern of joining two sentences with a semicolon (;) and omitting the ending full stop.

*Add any language-specific instructions as required to subtopics. See a few examples:*
* *Does your language require specific instructions for the handling of dashes (such as changing an em dash to en dash/colon)? 
* *Does your language add spaces before a punctuation mark, such as colon, exclamation mark?
* *Do double-byte languages require specific punctuation instructions?

 Periods
 Colons
 Commas
 Hyphens and Dashes

*If any of the punctuation marks above does not exist in your language or there are no specific instructions, delete it from the list.
