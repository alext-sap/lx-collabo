# Cross-References and Hyperlinks

Cross-references and hyperlinks are used to point the end user to additional or related information. They need to be placed in the right position in translation and, typically, there is no other work required. But there are a few things to keep in mind.

* Don't append any explanatory text in parentheses whether the target of a cross-reference or hyperlink is translated or not, unless instructed otherwise.
* Submit a query if a cross-reference or hyperlink is made available for translation and if its translation status is not clear.

*Provide any other guidelines on how to translate cross-references and hyperlinks. (See, for example, query 845636.)*

*For example:*

* *Should you use quotation marks for a cross-reference or hyperlink?*
* *Should translators use standard formulations? If so, elaborate on those standard formulations. (You can include this information under [Standard Phrases](/docs/template/06_additional_guidance_for_translators/standard_phrases.md).)*
