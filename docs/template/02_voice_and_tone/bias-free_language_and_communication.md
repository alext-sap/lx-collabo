# Bias-Free Language and Communication

Bias-free communication does not stereotype or discriminate against people with regard to culture, gender, ethnicity, language, and similar categories. It's about treating everybody in a fair and respectful way.

SAP is working on an ongoing project called Inclusive Language Project with the goal of reviewing and replacing insensitive terms used in the software industry.

*Please provide guidelines on how to achieve this for your language. If none, please delete this paragraph.*

## Gender and Gender-Neutral Language

Translating in a gender-neutral style has different challenges for different languages. There are languages that have grammaticalized gender in nouns, pronouns, noun/adjective agreement, (pro)noun/verb agreement, and so on. Be careful not to stretch the language to the limits of grammar and comprehensibility. 

*Provide guidelines for handling the user gender or cases when gender neutrality is not possible (ie. use masculine).*

* *Avoid gender when referring to the user? If so, any tips?*
* *Is it acceptable to use masculine to refer to male and female users?*
* *Other considerations?*
* *If no gender-related guidelines are needed, delete the instruction in italics.*
