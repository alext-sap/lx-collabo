# People-Centric Language

The people-centric approach involves creating content that is tailored specifically to the needs of the target group. It’s all about understanding the target group perspective and tailoring the content to that perspective at all levels. This ranges from information architecture and output format to the tone of voice and the words to be chosen at sentence level.

## How does PCA affect the language used in English texts?

If PCA is applied in English texts, you might see: 

* Contractions ("you'll")
* Addressing the user with "you" to keep focus on the target audience
* Conversational transitions like "here’s how", "take a look", "you’ll see", as opposed to formal, written style transitions like "as follows", "shown below", "as such", "as a result"
* Actionable transitions like "learn more", "see what’s new", "explore more options" – as these get the user doing something
* Relaxation of some stylistic rules (the ones taught in school) such as "never start a sentence with 'But' or 'And'"

> **Note:** Remember that PCA is not a set of rules but an approach that strives to deliver the content to the target audience in a most appropriate and meaninful manner. Texts that do not possess any of the characteristics above cannot be said to be non-PCA because they may not be appropriate for their target audience.
