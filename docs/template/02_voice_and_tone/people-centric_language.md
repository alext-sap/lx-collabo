# People-Centric Language

The people-centric approach involves creating content that is tailored specifically to the needs of the target group. It’s all about understanding the target group perspective and tailoring the content to that perspective at all levels. This ranges from information architecture and output format to the tone of voice and the words to be chosen at sentence level.

## How does PCA affect the language used in English texts?

If PCA is applied in English texts, you might see: 

* Contractions ("you'll")
* Addressing the user with "you" to keep focus on the target audience
* Conversational transitions like "here’s how", "take a look", "you’ll see", as opposed to formal, written style transitions like "as follows", "shown below", "as such", "as a result"
* Actionable transitions like "learn more", "see what’s new", "explore more options" – as these get the user doing something
* Relaxation of some stylistic rules (the ones taught in school) such as "never start a sentence with 'But' or 'And'"

> **Note:** Remember that PCA is not a set of rules but an approach that strives to deliver the content to the target audience in a most appropriate and meaninful manner. Texts that do not possess the above characteristics cannot be said to be non-PCA as it may be that they are not appropriate for their target audience.

## How does this impact translation?

The following are some general PCA guidelines from the viewpoint of translation:

* It is OK to play with stylistic rules within the confines of your languages as long as you don't bend grammar rules (wrong tenses, prepositions, or word order).
* Don’t deviate from the source text unnecessarily in terms of direct vs. indirect speech or active vs. passive voice, unless your language conventions call for it.
