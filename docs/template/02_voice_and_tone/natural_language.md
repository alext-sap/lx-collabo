# Natural Language

Translations should sound natural to the reader, as if the text had been originally written in the target language. Therefore, please avoid word by word translations or expressions that sound borrowed or incorrect.

*Provide specific points to help translation to sound natural and examples of common mistakes due to literal translations. If you don't consider this necessary, remove this part of the section (keep paragraph above).*

*Examples of guidelines:*

* *Preference for active, passive or impersonal voice?*
* *Preference for positive sentences rather than negative? (ie. Don't forget to... VS Remember to...)*
* *Is double negative acceptable in your target language?*
* *Preference for definite article vs indefinite article in some cases?*
