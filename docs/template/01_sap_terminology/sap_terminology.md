# SAP Terminology

SAP terminology and glossary definitions are created in SAPterm by user assistance developers and translators in more than 40 languages. SAPterm also contains information such as invalid synonyms, invalid spellings, and source information.

You encounter terminology everywhere and a subset of terminology is documented in SAPterm. In all instances, carefully follow all terminology guidelines and standards on the Support Portal. Make sure you:

* Translate into the language of your target audience. Do not invent your own terms or use jargon, slang or colloquialisms. Respect and follow the conventions for your language. 
* Follow the guidelines in [Terminology Quality - Target Languages](https://translation.sap.com/terminology.html) to ensure your terms correctly and accurately communicate the meaning of the concept.
* Avoid using the same term to mean different things unless they are already established homonyms in your language.
* Do not use synonyms. That is, do not use different terms to refer to the same thing. See the [standard for synonyms and rejected terms](https://translation.sap.com/terminology.html).
* If there are inconsistent terms in the source text, submit a query or follow up with your PM. 

Most concepts are best represented by terms native to their linguistic environment. See [Universal Terms](https://translation.sap.com/terminology.html) for specific guidelines on terms that should not be translated.
