# Unit of Measurement

Do not convert measurements unless requested in the project instructions. In case of doubt, contact LX.

Translate the unit of measurement but do not replace it with locale-specific unit of measurement unless instructed. For example, translate the word "yards" but do not replace it with the translation of "meters".

*Provide language specific guidelines including abbreviations (hr, sec, min, inches, kg, etc.), calendars, use of non-breaking spaces, use of digits vs numbers in writing, etc.*
