# Lists

Lists make information easy to consume. Follow the guidelines below when translating lists:

* Punctuation: Do not add a final punctuation mark that's not present in the source text. List elements could be reused and reorganized in a way that makes the punctuation no longer valid.

*Please provide guidelines on how to translate lists. You may ask translators to follow the relevant rules for your language (specify such rules as a reminder) or instruct them to follow the source style.*

* *Consistency: is it important that the list elements follow a consistent style?*
* *Style: does your language prefer verbal phrases or noun phrases?*

*If there are no additional instructions, remove the section in italics.*
