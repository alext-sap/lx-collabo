# Cross-References and Hyperlinks

Cross-references and hyperlinks are used to point the end user to additional or related information. In manual translation, they are typically added as tags in source texts, so they only need to be placed in the right position in translation.

There are cases, however, where cross-reference texts and hyperlinks are made available for translation and localization:

* For translatable cross-reference texts, simply copy the translation if their target is translated.
    * See [Standard Phrases](../06_additional_guidance_for_translators/standard_phrases.md) for information on standard translation style for cross-references.
    * If the target is not translated or if its translation status is not clear, see [Cross-References for Untranslated Target](cross-references_for_untranslated_target.md) for information on what to do.
* For localizable hyperlinks, look for the author's comment on how to localize it.

*Provide any other guidelines on how to translate cross-references and hyperlinks. For example:*

* *Should you use quotation marks for a cross-reference?*
