# Hotkeys (non-ABAP only)

A hotkey is a key combination that users press at runtime to trigger an action. One of the keys is always a modifier key, such as the Alt or Ctrl key. Developers typically place an ampersand (&) in front of the hotkey letter. Sometimes they use an underscore (_).

*Provide any guidelines on translating hotkeys below. If none, delete this instruction part. The following are examples:*

* *Choose the same letter as in the source.*
* *If the same letter is not present in the translation, a different letter may be chosen.*
* *Take care not to place the hotkey in front of a very narrow letter or in front of a special character letter.*

## Example

|Source Text|Target Text|
|---|---|
|&Name|\<example in your language\>|
|Viewer Colo&rs|\<example in your language\>|
|Save as &Template|\<example in your language\>|
|Align _Bottom|\<example in your language\>|
|Align _Center|\<example in your language>\|

> **Note:** In rare cases, hotkeys may also be represented by a standalone character in the source text. If you encounter such standalone characters, the above instructions may not apply. Please refer to your project-specific instructions, contact your PM, or submit a query in Query Tracker.
