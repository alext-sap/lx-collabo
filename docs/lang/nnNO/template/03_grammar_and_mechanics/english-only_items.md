# English-only Items

Source texts may contain references to items that are only available in English. These include UI element texts of untranslated SAP or third-party products and the title of a document or web page that is not translated.

> Be sure to submit a query if the translation status of such items is not clear.

* *Provide guidelines on how to handle references to English-only items that are not available in your language. What's preferred for your language -- leave them untranslated, translate them, or leave them in English and provide translation in parentheses?*

* *Include the instruction not to add "English-only" in parentheses to such references if your policy is to leave them in English because the situation may change over time.*
