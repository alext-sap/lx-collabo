# UI Text Types (non-ABAP only)

In non-ABAP products, UI element texts can be classified with a text type in property files. It indicates the kind of UI element for which the text is used, providing translators with contextual information for what they are translating. Refer to the table below for information on specific text types.

*Provide any other information you want your translators to know for your language.*

> It is not mandatory for developers to provide text type information. Consequently, files may have no or inappropriate text type information. Be sure to check other contextual information, if available, such as string ID and developer comment.
