# Grammar and Mechanics

There is no question about the importance of professional expertise of translators working for SAP. They are thoroughly versed in the grammatical rules of the source and target languages and well-acquainted with the nuts and bolts of translation.

This section, therefore, is primarily **not about the commonsensical knowledge** expected of translators but it's **about the specific ways in which certain aspects of language and translation must be handled for SAP**. It deals with such questions as:

* How should a certain linguistic or technical element be treated for SAP?
* Which option does SAP prefer if there are more than one to render a certain linguistic or technical element?
* Is there any exception to the rule?
* Is there any standard practice translators should be reminded of?
