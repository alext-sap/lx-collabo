# LX Markdown Support

This document describes what Markdown features are currently supported by XTM Cloud, a translation management system LX adopted. If features not covered here are to be used, LX will need to address them in consultation with the solution provider so that they will not disrupt the existing translation process.

If they prove to be unsupportable by XTM, LX will evaluate the amount of effort required to enable support before committing resources to the effort.
