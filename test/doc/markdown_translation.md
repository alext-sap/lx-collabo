# What Is Markdown?

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as **bold** or *italic*, adding images ![image](images/sap.jpg), and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown ([more info](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)). Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few `non-alphabetic` characters thrown in, like # or * or even " " (whitespace).

XTM parses these characters according to the Markdown syntax and displays many of them as inline tags in XTM Workbench. Content authored in Markdown heavily depends on these characters for styling so it is essneital that inline tags should be taken care of correctly in order to realize a translated output as orignally styled.
