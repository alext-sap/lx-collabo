There are two types of inline tags. One is green tags in pair and the other standalone blue tags.

It is helpful to remember that green tags typically represent formatting such as bold and italics while blue tags represent such text elements as variables and links.

It is important to check what each tag represents in the **Inline tags** view of XTM Workbench so inline tags are placed in correct sequence and position in translation. Failure to do so can result in malformed or incorrect output.
